The goal of the app is to increase security when accessing internet banking applications through SMS token-based authentication. After logging in or registering, the user must select banking apps, which, when accessed, will require an answer to a secret question sent via SMS. A correct answer grants access to the banking app for a limited time. In case of an incorrect answer, the exact location of the device is sent to the user via email, providing an additional layer of security.",
