        "content": "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and currently pursuing three postgraduate courses: Fullstack Development for Cloud, MIT Software Engineering with Java, and MIT Software Architecture. With 5 years of experience, I have worked on the development of ERP systems, REST APIs, and projects encompassing both microservices and monoliths, as well as dealing with legacy systems. At Torrecid, I worked with Visual Basic .NET and PL/SQL, developing and maintaining internal solutions for various areas of the company. My specialty is the Java ecosystem (Java 17, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, Maven), with experience in front-end development using React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have solid knowledge of databases, including PL/SQL (Oracle), PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Furthermore, I have extensive experience in CI/CD environments and using tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and Quarkus for container automation and orchestration."

The goal of the app is to increase security when accessing internet banking applications through SMS token-based authentication. After logging in or registering, the user must select banking apps, which, when accessed, will require an answer to a secret question sent via SMS. A correct answer grants access to the banking app for a limited time. In case of an incorrect answer, the exact location of the device is sent to the user via email, providing an additional layer of security.",

            "description": "This project is an ERP system developed for small retailers, designed to simplify and enhance operations such as product management, customer and supplier management, and assist in the sales process. The repository contains the source code for the main Produlink project and its integration with the RESTful API Produlink-API for database requests. Main features include product registration, allowing detailed information about products, customer management with records of names, addresses, and purchase histories, supplier management with contact information and payment terms, and a sales process that facilitates order creation, inventory control, and report generation. Technologies used include Front-end in Java Swing, Back-end in Java integrated with the Produlink-API, Docker as a container, and PostgreSQL as the database. This project is ideal for developers interested in building a customized ERP system for small retailers, offering the opportunity to enhance software development skills, work with modern technologies, and collaborate on an open-source project.",
